		Loads a TensorFlow plugin, containing custom ops and kernels.
		
		Pass "library_filename" to a platform-specific mechanism for dynamically
		loading a library. The rules for determining the exact location of the
		library are platform-specific and are not documented here. When the
		library is loaded, ops and kernels registered in the library via the
		REGISTER_* macros are made available in the TensorFlow process. Note
		that ops with the same name as an existing op are rejected and not
		registered with the process.
		
		Args:
		  library_filename: Path to the plugin.
		    Relative or absolute filesystem path to a dynamic library file.
		
		Returns:
		  A python module containing the Python wrappers for Ops defined in
		  the plugin.
		
		Raises:
		  RuntimeError: when unable to load the library or get the python wrappers.
