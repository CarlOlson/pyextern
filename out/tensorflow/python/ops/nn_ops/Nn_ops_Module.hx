		Atrous convolution (a.k.a. convolution with holes or dilated convolution).
		
		Computes a 2-D atrous convolution, also known as convolution with holes or
		dilated convolution, given 4-D `value` and `filters` tensors. If the `rate`
		parameter is equal to one, it performs regular 2-D convolution. If the `rate`
		parameter is greater than one, it performs convolution with holes, sampling
		the input values every `rate` pixels in the `height` and `width` dimensions.
		This is equivalent to convolving the input with a set of upsampled filters,
		produced by inserting `rate - 1` zeros between two consecutive values of the
		filters along the `height` and `width` dimensions, hence the name atrous
		convolution or convolution with holes (the French word trous means holes in
		English).
		
		More specifically:
		
		    output[b, i, j, k] = sum_{di, dj, q} filters[di, dj, q, k] *
		          value[b, i + rate * di, j + rate * dj, q]
		
		Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control how densely to compute
		feature responses in fully convolutional networks. Used in conjunction with
		bilinear interpolation, it offers an alternative to `conv2d_transpose` in
		dense prediction tasks such as semantic image segmentation, optical flow
		computation, or depth estimation. It also allows us to effectively enlarge
		the field of view of filters without increasing the number of parameters or
		the amount of computation.
		
		For a description of atrous convolution and how it can be used for dense
		feature extraction, please see: [Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep
		Convolutional Nets and Fully Connected CRFs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7062).
		The same operation is investigated further in [Multi-Scale Context Aggregation
		by Dilated Convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07122). Previous works
		that effectively use atrous convolution in different ways are, among others,
		[OverFeat: Integrated Recognition, Localization and Detection using
		Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6229) and [Fast Image
		Scanning with Deep Max-Pooling Convolutional Neural Networks]
		(http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1700). Atrous convolution is also closely related
		to the so-called noble identities in multi-rate signal processing.
		
		There are many different ways to implement atrous convolution (see the refs
		above). The implementation here reduces
		
		    atrous_conv2d(value, filters, rate, padding=padding)
		
		to the following three operations:
		
		    paddings = ...
		    net = space_to_batch(value, paddings, block_size=rate)
		    net = conv2d(net, filters, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="VALID")
		    crops = ...
		    net = batch_to_space(net, crops, block_size=rate)
		
		Advanced usage. Note the following optimization: A sequence of `atrous_conv2d`
		operations with identical `rate` parameters, 'SAME' `padding`, and filters
		with odd heights/ widths:
		
		    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters1, rate, padding="SAME")
		    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters2, rate, padding="SAME")
		    ...
		    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filtersK, rate, padding="SAME")
		
		can be equivalently performed cheaper in terms of computation and memory as:
		
		    pad = ...  # padding so that the input dims are multiples of rate
		    net = space_to_batch(net, paddings=pad, block_size=rate)
		    net = conv2d(net, filters1, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
		    net = conv2d(net, filters2, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
		    ...
		    net = conv2d(net, filtersK, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
		    net = batch_to_space(net, crops=pad, block_size=rate)
		
		because a pair of consecutive `space_to_batch` and `batch_to_space` ops with
		the same `block_size` cancel out when their respective `paddings` and `crops`
		inputs are identical.
		
		Args:
		  value: A 4-D `Tensor` of type `float`. It needs to be in the default "NHWC"
		    format. Its shape is `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.
		  filters: A 4-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape
		    `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. `filters`'
		    `in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`. Atrous convolution is
		    equivalent to standard convolution with upsampled filters with effective
		    height `filter_height + (filter_height - 1) * (rate - 1)` and effective
		    width `filter_width + (filter_width - 1) * (rate - 1)`, produced by
		    inserting `rate - 1` zeros along consecutive elements across the
		    `filters`' spatial dimensions.
		  rate: A positive int32. The stride with which we sample input values across
		    the `height` and `width` dimensions. Equivalently, the rate by which we
		    upsample the filter values by inserting zeros across the `height` and
		    `width` dimensions. In the literature, the same parameter is sometimes
		    called `input stride` or `dilation`.
		  padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm.
		  name: Optional name for the returned tensor.
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filters`' shape, or if
		    padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.
