		strings with the given separator (default: empty string).  Negative indices are
		counted backwards from the end, with `-1` being equivalent to `n - 1`.
		
		For example:
		
		```python
		# tensor `a` is [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]
		tf.reduce_join(a, 0) ==> ["ac", "bd"]
		tf.reduce_join(a, 1) ==> ["ab", "cd"]

		tf.reduce_join(a, 0, keep_dims=True) ==> [["ac", "bd"]]
		tf.reduce_join(a, 1, keep_dims=True) ==> [["ab"], ["cd"]]
		tf.reduce_join(a, 0, separator=".") ==> ["a.c", "b.d"]

		  axis: A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
		    The dimensions to reduce over.  Dimensions are reduced in the

		    `[n-1, n-2, ..., 0]`.  Negative indices from `-n` to `-1` are supported.
		  keep_dims: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.
		    If `True`, retain reduced dimensions with length `1`.

		Split elements of `source` based on `delimiter` into a `SparseTensor`.
		
		Let N be the size of source (typically N will be the batch size). Split each

		containing the split tokens. Empty tokens are ignored.
		
		If `delimiter` is an empty string, each element of the `source` is split
		into individual strings, each containing one byte. (This includes splitting
		multibyte sequences of UTF-8.) If delimiter contains multiple bytes, it is
		treated as a set of delimiters with each considered a potential split point.
		
		For example:

		Converts each string in the input Tensor to its hash mod by a number of buckets.
		
		The hash function is deterministic on the content of the string within the

		defines the key of the hash function. `key` is an array of 2 elements.
		
		A strong hash is important when inputs may be malicious, e.g. URLs with
		additional components. Adversaries could try to make their inputs hash to the
		same bucket for a denial-of-service attack or to skew the results. A strong
		hash prevents this by making it difficult, if not infeasible, to compute inputs
		that hash to the same bucket. This comes at a cost of roughly 4x higher compute
		time than `tf.string_to_hash_bucket_fast`.

		If `len` defines a substring that would extend beyond the length of the input
		string, then as many characters as possible are used.
		
		If `pos` is negative or specifies a character index larger than any of the input
		strings, then an `InvalidArgumentError` is thrown.
		
		`pos` and `len` must have the same shape, otherwise a `ValueError` is thrown on
