		Overload for Tensor.__getitem__.
		
		This operation extracts the specified region from the tensor.
		The notation is similar to NumPy with the restriction that
		currently only support basic indexing. That means that
		using a tensor as input is not currently allowed
		
		Some useful examples:
		
		```python
		# strip leading and trailing 2 elements
		foo = tf.constant([1,2,3,4,5,6])
		print(foo[2:-2].eval()) # => [3,4]
		
		# skip every row and reverse every column
		foo = tf.constant([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]])
		print(foo[::2,::-1].eval()) # => [[3,2,1], [9,8,7]]
		
		# Insert another dimension
		foo = tf.constant([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]])
		print(foo[tf.newaxis, :, :].eval()) # => [[[3,2,1], [9,8,7]]]
		print(foo[:, tf.newaxis, :].eval()) # => [[[3,2,1]], [[9,8,7]]]
		print(foo[:, :, tf.newaxis].eval()) # => [[[3],[2],[1]], [[9],[8],[7]]]
		
		# Ellipses (3 equivalent operations)
		print(foo[tf.newaxis, :, :].eval()) # => [[[3,2,1], [9,8,7]]]
		print(foo[tf.newaxis, ...].eval()) # => [[[3,2,1], [9,8,7]]]
		print(foo[tf.newaxis].eval()) # => [[[3,2,1], [9,8,7]]]
		```
		
		Notes:
		  - `tf.newaxis` is `None` as in NumPy.
		  - An implicit ellipsis is placed at the end of the `slice_spec`
		  - NumPy advanced indexing is currently not supported.
		
		Args:
		  tensor: An ops.Tensor object.
		  slice_spec: The arguments to Tensor.__getitem__.
		  var: In the case of variable slice assignment, the Variable
		    object to slice (i.e. tensor is the read-only view of this
		    variable).
		
		Returns:
		  The appropriate slice of "tensor", based on "slice_spec".
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If a slice range is negative size.
		  TypeError: If the slice indices aren't int, slice, or Ellipsis.

		Creates a slice helper object given a variable.
		
		This allows creating a sub-tensor from part of the current contents
		of a variable.  See ${tf.Tensor$`Tensor.__getitem__`}
		for detailed examples of slicing.
		
		This function in addition also allows assignment to a sliced range.
		This is similar to `__setitem__` functionality in Python. However,
		the syntax is different so that the user can capture the assignment
		operation for grouping or passing to `sess.run()`.
		For example,
		
		```prettyprint
		import tensorflow as tf
		A = tf.Variable([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], dtype=tf.float32)
		with tf.Session() as sess:

		  print sess.run(op) # => [[22, 22, 3], [22, 22, 6], [7,8,9]]
		```

		semantics.

		BatchToSpace for 4-D tensors of type T.
		
		This is a legacy version of the more general BatchToSpaceND.
		
		Rearranges (permutes) data from batch into blocks of spatial data, followed by
		cropping. This is the reverse transformation of SpaceToBatch. More specifically,
		this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the `batch`
		dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the `height` and `width` dimensions,
		followed by cropping along the `height` and `width` dimensions.
		
		Args:
		  input: A `Tensor`. 4-D tensor with shape
		    `[batch*block_size*block_size, height_pad/block_size, width_pad/block_size,
		      depth]`. Note that the batch size of the input tensor must be divisible by
		    `block_size * block_size`.
		  crops: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
		    2-D tensor of non-negative integers with shape `[2, 2]`. It specifies
		    how many elements to crop from the intermediate result across the spatial
		    dimensions as follows:
		
		        crops = [[crop_top, crop_bottom], [crop_left, crop_right]]
		  block_size: An `int` that is `>= 2`.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
		  4-D with shape `[batch, height, width, depth]`, where:
		
		        height = height_pad - crop_top - crop_bottom
		        width = width_pad - crop_left - crop_right
		
		  The attr `block_size` must be greater than one. It indicates the block size.
		
		  Some examples:
		
		  (1) For the following input of shape `[4, 1, 1, 1]` and block_size of 2:

		  [[[[1]]], [[[2]]], [[[3]]], [[[4]]]]

		  ```
		
		  The output tensor has shape `[1, 2, 2, 3]` and value:
		
		  ```
		  x = [[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],

		BatchToSpace for N-D tensors of type T.
		
		This operation reshapes the "batch" dimension 0 into `M + 1` dimensions of shape
		`block_shape + [batch]`, interleaves these blocks back into the grid defined by
		the spatial dimensions `[1, ..., M]`, to obtain a result with the same rank as
		the input.  The spatial dimensions of this intermediate result are then
		optionally cropped according to `crops` to produce the output.  This is the
		reverse of SpaceToBatch.  See below for a precise description.
		
		Args:
		  input: A `Tensor`.
		    N-D with shape `input_shape = [batch] + spatial_shape + remaining_shape`,
		    where spatial_shape has M dimensions.
		  block_shape: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
		    1-D with shape `[M]`, all values must be >= 1.
		  crops: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
		    2-D with shape `[M, 2]`, all values must be >= 0.
		      `crops[i] = [crop_start, crop_end]` specifies the amount to crop from input
		      dimension `i + 1`, which corresponds to spatial dimension `i`.  It is
		      required that
		      `crop_start[i] + crop_end[i] <= block_shape[i] * input_shape[i + 1]`.
		
		    This operation is equivalent to the following steps:
		
		    1. Reshape `input` to `reshaped` of shape:
		         [block_shape[0], ..., block_shape[M-1],
		          batch / prod(block_shape),
		          input_shape[1], ..., input_shape[N-1]]

		          ...,
		          input_shape[M], block_shape[M-1],
		
		          input_shape[M+1], ..., input_shape[N-1]]
		
		    3. Reshape `permuted` to produce `reshaped_permuted` of shape
		         [batch / prod(block_shape),
		
		          input_shape[1] * block_shape[0],

		          input_shape[M+1],
		          ...,
		          input_shape[N-1]]
		
		    4. Crop the start and end of dimensions `[1, ..., M]` of
		       `reshaped_permuted` according to `crops` to produce the output of shape:
		         [batch / prod(block_shape),
		
		          input_shape[1] * block_shape[0] - crops[0,0] - crops[0,1],
		          ...,

		          input_shape[M+1], ..., input_shape[N-1]]

		 The argument `value` can be a constant value, or a list of values of type

		DepthToSpace for tensors of type T.
		
		Rearranges data from depth into blocks of spatial data.
		This is the reverse transformation of SpaceToDepth. More specifically,
		this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the `depth`
		dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the `height` and `width` dimensions.
		The attr `block_size` indicates the input block size and how the data is moved.
		
		  * Chunks of data of size `block_size * block_size` from depth are rearranged
		    into non-overlapping blocks of size `block_size x block_size`
		  * The width the output tensor is `input_depth * block_size`, whereas the
		    height is `input_height * block_size`.
		  * The depth of the input tensor must be divisible by
		    `block_size * block_size`.
		
		That is, assuming the input is in the shape:
		`[batch, height, width, depth]`,
		the shape of the output will be:
		`[batch, height*block_size, width*block_size, depth/(block_size*block_size)]`
		
		This operation requires that the input tensor be of rank 4, and that
		`block_size` be >=1 and that `block_size * block_size` be a divisor of the
		input depth.
		
		This operation is useful for resizing the activations between convolutions
		(but keeping all data), e.g. instead of pooling. It is also useful for training
		purely convolutional models.
		
		For example, given this input of shape `[1, 1, 1, 4]`, and a block size of 2:
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4]]]]
		
		```
		
		This operation will output a tensor of shape `[1, 2, 2, 1]`:
		
		```
		   [[[[1], [2]],
		     [[3], [4]]]]
		```
		
		Here, the input has a batch of 1 and each batch element has shape `[1, 1, 4]`,
		the corresponding output will have 2x2 elements and will have a depth of
		1 channel (1 = `4 / (block_size * block_size)`).
		The output element shape is `[2, 2, 1]`.
		
		For an input tensor with larger depth, here of shape `[1, 1, 1, 12]`, e.g.
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]]]
		```
		
		This operation, for block size of 2, will return the following tensor of shape
		`[1, 2, 2, 3]`
		
		```
		   [[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
		     [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]]
		
		```
		
		Similarly, for the following input of shape `[1 2 2 4]`, and a block size of 2:
		
		```
		x =  [[[[1, 2, 3, 4],
		       [5, 6, 7, 8]],
		      [[9, 10, 11, 12],
		       [13, 14, 15, 16]]]]
		```
		
		the operator will return the following tensor of shape `[1 4 4 1]`:
		
		```
		x = [[ [1],   [2],  [5],  [6]],
		     [ [3],   [4],  [7],  [8]],
		     [ [9],  [10], [13],  [14]],

		Dequantize the 'input' tensor into a float Tensor.
		
		[min_range, max_range] are scalar floats that specify the range for

		In 'MIN_COMBINED' mode, each value of the tensor will undergo the following:
		
		```
		if T == qint8, in[i] += (range(T) + 1)/ 2.0

		If the input comes from a QuantizedRelu6, the output type is

		each value by 128 prior to casting.
		
		If the mode is 'MIN_FIRST', then this approach is used:
		
		```c++
		number_of_steps = 1 << (# of bits in T)
		range_adjust = number_of_steps / (number_of_steps - 1)

		Quantizes then dequantizes a tensor.
		
		This op simulates the precision loss from the quantized forward pass by:
		1. Quantizing the tensor to fixed point numbers, which should match the target
		   quantization method when it is used in inference.
		2. Dequantizing it back to floating point numbers for the following ops, most
		   likely matmul.
		
		There are different ways to quantize. This version does not use the full range
		of the output type, choosing to elide the lowest possible value for symmetry
		(e.g., output range is -127 to 127, not -128 to 127 for signed 8 bit
		quantization), so that 0.0 maps to 0.
		
		To perform this op, we first find the range of values in our tensor. The range
		we use is always centered on 0, so we find m such that
		
		1. m = max(abs(input_min), abs(input_max)) if range_given is true,
		2. m = max(abs(min_elem(input)), abs(max_elem(input))) otherwise.
		
		Our input tensor range is then [-m, m].
		
		Next, we choose our fixed-point quantization buckets, [min_fixed, max_fixed].
		If signed_input is true, this is
		
		  [min_fixed, max_fixed ] =
		      [-(1 << (num_bits - 1) - 1), (1 << (num_bits - 1)) - 1].
		
		Otherwise, if signed_input is false, the fixed-point range is
		
		  [min_fixed, max_fixed] = [0, (1 << num_bits) - 1].
		
		From this we compute our scaling factor, s:
		
		  s = (max_fixed - min_fixed) / (2 * m).
		
		Now we can quantize and dequantize the elements of our tensor.  An element e
		is transformed into e':
		
		  e' = (e * s).round_to_nearest() / s.
		
		Note that we have a different number of buckets in the signed vs. unsigned
		cases.  For example, if num_bits == 8, we get 254 buckets in the signed case
		vs. 255 in the unsigned case.
		
		For example, suppose num_bits = 8 and m = 1.  Then
		
		  [min_fixed, max_fixed] = [-127, 127], and
		  s = (127 + 127) / 2 = 127.
		
		Given the vector {-1, -0.5, 0, 0.3}, this is quantized to
		{-127, -63, 0, 38}, and dequantized to {-1, -63.0/127, 0, 38.0/127}.

		  input: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`.

		  input_min: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`.
		    If range_given, this is the min of the range, otherwise this input
		    will be ignored.
		  input_max: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`.
		    If range_given, this is the max of the range, otherwise this input
		    will be ignored.

	/**
		Quantize the 'input' tensor of type float to 'output' tensor of type 'T'.
		
		[min_range, max_range] are scalar floats that specify the range for
		the 'input' data. The 'mode' attribute controls exactly which calculations are
		used to convert the float values to their quantized equivalents.
		
		In 'MIN_COMBINED' mode, each value of the tensor will undergo the following:
		
		```
		out[i] = (in[i] - min_range) * range(T) / (max_range - min_range)
		if T == qint8, out[i] -= (range(T) + 1) / 2.0
		```
		here `range(T) = numeric_limits<T>::max() - numeric_limits<T>::min()`
		
		*MIN_COMBINED Mode Example*
		
		Assume the input is type float and has a possible range of [0.0, 6.0] and the
		output type is quint8 ([0, 255]). The min_range and max_range values should be
		specified as 0.0 and 6.0. Quantizing from float to quint8 will multiply each
		value of the input by 255/6 and cast to quint8.
		
		If the output type was qint8 ([-128, 127]), the operation will additionally
		subtract each value by 128 prior to casting, so that the range of values aligns
		with the range of qint8.
		
		If the mode is 'MIN_FIRST', then this approach is used:
		
		```
		number_of_steps = 1 << (# of bits in T)
		range_adjust = number_of_steps / (number_of_steps - 1)
		range = (range_max - range_min) * range_adjust
		range_scale = number_of_steps / range
		quantized = round(input * range_scale) - round(range_min * range_scale) +
		  numeric_limits<T>::min()
		quantized = max(quantized, numeric_limits<T>::min())
		quantized = min(quantized, numeric_limits<T>::max())
		```
		
		The biggest difference between this and MIN_COMBINED is that the minimum range
		is rounded first, before it's subtracted from the rounded value. With
		MIN_COMBINED, a small bias is introduced where repeated iterations of quantizing
		and dequantizing will introduce a larger and larger error.
		
		One thing to watch out for is that the operator may choose to adjust the
		requested minimum and maximum values slightly during the quantization process,
		so you should always use the output ports as the range for further calculations.
		For example, if the requested minimum and maximum values are close to equal,
		they will be separated by a small epsilon value to prevent ill-formed quantized
		buffers from being created. Otherwise, you can end up with buffers where all the
		quantized values map to the same float value, which causes problems for
		operations that have to perform further calculations on them.

		Reshapes a tensor.
		
		Given `tensor`, this operation returns a tensor that has the same values
		as `tensor` with shape `shape`.
		
		If one component of `shape` is the special value -1, the size of that dimension
		is computed so that the total size remains constant.  In particular, a `shape`
		of `[-1]` flattens into 1-D.  At most one component of `shape` can be -1.
		
		If `shape` is 1-D or higher, then the operation returns a tensor with shape
		`shape` filled with the values of `tensor`. In this case, the number of elements
		implied by `shape` must be the same as the number of elements in `tensor`.

		This operation divides "spatial" dimensions `[1, ..., M]` of the input into a

		This operation is useful for resizing the activations between convolutions

	/**
		Extracts a strided slice of a tensor (generalized python array indexing).
		
		**Most users will want to use @{tf.Tensor.__getitem__} and
		@{tf.Variable.__getitem__}.** That allows  NumPy style slicing syntax (i.e.
		`tensor[..., 3:4:-1, tf.newaxis, 3]`).
		This op is the low-level interface that are used to implement operators.
		Those interfaces are much more friendly, and highly recommended.
		
		To a first order, this operation extracts a slice of size `end - begin`
		from a tensor `input`
		starting at the location specified by `begin`. The slice continues by adding
		`stride` to the `begin` index until all dimensions are not less than `end`.
		Note that components of stride can be negative, which causes a reverse
		slice.
		
		This operation can be thought of an encoding of a numpy style sliced
		range. Given a python slice input[<spec0>, <spec1>, ..., <specn>]
		this function will be called as follows.
		
		`begin`, `end`, and `strides` will be all length n. n is in general
		not the same dimensionality as `input`.
		
		For the ith spec,
		`begin_mask`, `end_mask`, `ellipsis_mask`, `new_axis_mask`,
		and `shrink_axis_mask` will have the ith bit corresponding to
		the ith spec.
		
		If the ith bit of `begin_mask` is non-zero, `begin[i]` is ignored and
		the fullest possible range in that dimension is used instead.
		`end_mask` works analogously, except with the end range.
		
		`foo[5:,:,:3]` on a 7x8x9 tensor is equivalent to `foo[5:7,0:8,0:3]`.
		`foo[::-1]` reverses a tensor with shape 8.
		
		
		If the ith bit of `ellipsis_mask` is non-zero, as many unspecified dimensions
		as needed will be inserted between other dimensions. Only one
		non-zero bit is allowed in `ellipsis_mask`.
		
		For example `foo[3:5,...,4:5]` on a shape 10x3x3x10 tensor is
		equivalent to `foo[3:5,:,:,4:5]` and
		`foo[3:5,...]` is equivalent to `foo[3:5,:,:,:]`.
		
		If the ith bit of `new_axis_mask` is one, then `begin`,
		`end`, and `stride` are ignored and a new length 1 dimension is
		added at this point in the output tensor.
		
		For example `foo[3:5,4]` on a 10x8 tensor produces a shape 2 tensor
		whereas `foo[3:5,4:5]` produces a shape 2x1 tensor with shrink_mask
		being 1<<1 == 2.
		
		If the ith bit of `shrink_axis_mask` is one, then `begin`,
		`end[i]`, and `stride[i]` are used to do a slice in the appropriate
		dimension, but the output tensor will be reduced in dimensionality
		by one. This is only valid if the ith entry of slice[i]==1.
		
		NOTE: `begin` and `end` are zero-indexed`.
		`strides` entries must be non-zero.
