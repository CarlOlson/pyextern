	/**
		Converts each entry in the given tensor to strings.  Supports many numeric
		
		types and boolean.
		
		Args:
		  input: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`, `complex64`, `float32`, `float64`, `bool`, `int8`.
		  precision: An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`.
		    The post-decimal precision to use for floating point numbers.
		    Only used if precision > -1.
		  scientific: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.
		    Use scientific notation for floating point numbers.
		  shortest: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.
		    Use shortest representation (either scientific or standard) for
		    floating point numbers.
		  width: An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`.
		    Pad pre-decimal numbers to this width.
		    Applies to both floating point and integer numbers.
		    Only used if width > -1.
		  fill: An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`.
		    The value to pad if width > -1.  If empty, pads with spaces.
		    Another typical value is '0'.  String cannot be longer than 1 character.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor` of type `string`.

	/**
		Joins a string Tensor across the given dimensions.
		
		Computes the string join across dimensions in the given string Tensor of shape
		`[d_0, d_1, ..., d_n-1]`.  Returns a new Tensor created by joining the input
		strings with the given separator (default: empty string).  Negative indices are
		counted backwards from the end, with `-1` being equivalent to `n - 1`.  Passing
		an empty `reduction_indices` joins all strings in linear index order and outputs
		a scalar string.
		
		
		For example:
		```
		# tensor `a` is [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]
		tf.reduce_join(a, 0) ==> ["ac", "bd"]
		tf.reduce_join(a, 1) ==> ["ab", "cd"]
		tf.reduce_join(a, -2) = tf.reduce_join(a, 0) ==> ["ac", "bd"]
		tf.reduce_join(a, -1) = tf.reduce_join(a, 1) ==> ["ab", "cd"]
		tf.reduce_join(a, 0, keep_dims=True) ==> [["ac", "bd"]]
		tf.reduce_join(a, 1, keep_dims=True) ==> [["ab"], ["cd"]]
		tf.reduce_join(a, 0, separator=".") ==> ["a.c", "b.d"]
		tf.reduce_join(a, [0, 1]) ==> ["acbd"]
		tf.reduce_join(a, [1, 0]) ==> ["abcd"]
		tf.reduce_join(a, []) ==> ["abcd"]
		```
		
		Args:
		  inputs: A `Tensor` of type `string`.
		    The input to be joined.  All reduced indices must have non-zero size.
		  reduction_indices: A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
		    The dimensions to reduce over.  Dimensions are reduced in the
		    order specified.  If `reduction_indices` has higher rank than `1`, it is
		    flattened.  Omitting `reduction_indices` is equivalent to passing
		    `[n-1, n-2, ..., 0]`.  Negative indices from `-n` to `-1` are supported.
		  keep_dims: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.
		    If `True`, retain reduced dimensions with length `1`.
		  separator: An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`.
		    The separator to use when joining.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor` of type `string`.
		  Has shape equal to that of the input with reduced dimensions removed or
		  set to `1` depending on `keep_dims`.

	/**
		Converts each string in the input Tensor to its hash mod by a number of buckets.
		
		The hash function is deterministic on the content of the string within the
		process. The hash function is a keyed hash function, where attribute `key`
		defines the key of the hash function. `key` is an array of 2 elements.
		
		A strong hash is important when inputs may be malicious, e.g. URLs with
		additional components. Adversaries could try to make their inputs hash to the
		same bucket for a denial-of-service attack or to skew the results. A strong
		hash prevents this by making it dificult, if not infeasible, to compute inputs
		that hash to the same bucket. This comes at a cost of roughly 4x higher compute
		time than tf.string_to_hash_bucket_fast.
		
		Args:
		  input: A `Tensor` of type `string`. The strings to assign a hash bucket.
		  num_buckets: An `int` that is `>= 1`. The number of buckets.
