		Update 'ref' by assigning 'value' to it.
		
		This operation outputs "ref" after the assignment is done.
		This makes it easier to chain operations that need to use the reset value.
		
		Args:
		  ref: A mutable `Tensor`.
		    Should be from a `Variable` node. May be uninitialized.
		  value: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `ref`.
		    The value to be assigned to the variable.
		  validate_shape: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`.
		    If true, the operation will validate that the shape
		    of 'value' matches the shape of the Tensor being assigned to.  If false,
		    'ref' will take on the shape of 'value'.
		  use_locking: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`.
		    If True, the assignment will be protected by a lock;
		    otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
		  Same as "ref".  Returned as a convenience for operations that want
		  to use the new value after the variable has been reset.
