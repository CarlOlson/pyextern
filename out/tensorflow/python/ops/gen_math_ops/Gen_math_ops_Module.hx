		Convert the quantized 'input' tensor into a lower-precision 'output', using the
		
		actual distribution of the values to maximize the usage of the lower bit depth
		and adjusting the output min and max ranges accordingly.
		
		[input_min, input_max] are scalar floats that specify the range for the float
		interpretation of the 'input' data. For example, if input_min is -1.0f and
		input_max is 1.0f, and we are dealing with quint16 quantized data, then a 0
		value in the 16-bit data should be interpreted as -1.0f, and a 65535 means 1.0f.
		
		This operator tries to squeeze as much precision as possible into an output with
		a lower bit depth by calculating the actual min and max values found in the
		data. For example, maybe that quint16 input has no values lower than 16,384 and
		none higher than 49,152. That means only half the range is actually needed, all
		the float interpretations are between -0.5f and 0.5f, so if we want to compress
		the data into a quint8 output, we can use that range rather than the theoretical
		-1.0f to 1.0f that is suggested by the input min and max.
		
		In practice, this is most useful for taking output from operations like
		QuantizedMatMul that can produce higher bit-depth outputs than their inputs and
		may have large potential output ranges, but in practice have a distribution of
		input values that only uses a small fraction of the possible range. By feeding
		that output into this operator, we can reduce it from 32 bits down to 8 with
		minimal loss of accuracy.
