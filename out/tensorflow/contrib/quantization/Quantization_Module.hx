		[min_range, max_range] are scalar floats that specify the range for
		the 'input' data. The 'mode' attribute controls exactly which calculations are
		used to convert the float values to their quantized equivalents.
		
		In 'MIN_COMBINED' mode, each value of the tensor will undergo the following:
		
		```
		if T == qint8, in[i] += (range(T) + 1)/ 2.0
		out[i] = min_range + (in[i]* (max_range - min_range) / range(T))

		*MIN_COMBINED Mode Example*
		
		If the input comes from a QuantizedRelu6, the output type is
		quint8 (range of 0-255) but the possible range of QuantizedRelu6 is
		0-6.  The min_range and max_range values are therefore 0.0 and 6.0.
		Dequantize on quint8 will take each value, cast to float, and multiply
		by 6 / 255.
		Note that if quantizedtype is qint8, the operation will additionally add
		each value by 128 prior to casting.
		
		If the mode is 'MIN_FIRST', then this approach is used:

		range_adjust = number_of_steps / (number_of_steps - 1)

	/**
		Performs fractional max pooling on the input.
		
		Fractional max pooling is slightly different than regular max pooling.  In
		regular max pooling, you downsize an input set by taking the maximum value of
		smaller N x N subsections of the set (often 2x2), and try to reduce the set by
		a factor of N, where N is an integer.  Fractional max pooling, as you might
		expect from the word "fractional", means that the overall reduction ratio N
		does not have to be an integer.
		
		The sizes of the pooling regions are generated randomly but are fairly uniform.
		For example, let's look at the height dimension, and the constraints on the
		list of rows that will be pool boundaries.
		
		First we define the following:
		
		1.  input_row_length : the number of rows from the input set
		2.  output_row_length : which will be smaller than the input
		3.  alpha = input_row_length / output_row_length : our reduction ratio
		4.  K = floor(alpha)
		5.  row_pooling_sequence : this is the result list of pool boundary rows
		
		Then, row_pooling_sequence should satisfy:
		
		1.  a[0] = 0 : the first value of the sequence is 0
		2.  a[end] = input_row_length : the last value of the sequence is the size
		3.  K <= (a[i+1] - a[i]) <= K+1 : all intervals are K or K+1 size
		4.  length(row_pooling_sequence) = output_row_length+1

		Convert the quantized 'input' tensor into a lower-precision 'output', using the
		
		actual distribution of the values to maximize the usage of the lower bit depth
		and adjusting the output min and max ranges accordingly.
		
		[input_min, input_max] are scalar floats that specify the range for the float
		interpretation of the 'input' data. For example, if input_min is -1.0f and
		input_max is 1.0f, and we are dealing with quint16 quantized data, then a 0
		value in the 16-bit data should be interpreted as -1.0f, and a 65535 means 1.0f.
		
		This operator tries to squeeze as much precision as possible into an output with
		a lower bit depth by calculating the actual min and max values found in the
		data. For example, maybe that quint16 input has no values lower than 16,384 and
		none higher than 49,152. That means only half the range is actually needed, all
		the float interpretations are between -0.5f and 0.5f, so if we want to compress
		the data into a quint8 output, we can use that range rather than the theoretical
		-1.0f to 1.0f that is suggested by the input min and max.
		
		In practice, this is most useful for taking output from operations like
		QuantizedMatMul that can produce higher bit-depth outputs than their inputs and
		may have large potential output ranges, but in practice have a distribution of
		input values that only uses a small fraction of the possible range. By feeding
		that output into this operator, we can reduce it from 32 bits down to 8 with
		minimal loss of accuracy.
		
		Args:
		  input: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `qint8`, `quint8`, `qint16`, `quint16`, `qint32`.
		  input_min: A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
		    The float value that the minimum quantized input value represents.
		  input_max: A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
		    The float value that the maximum quantized input value represents.
		  out_type: A `tf.DType` from: `tf.qint8, tf.quint8, tf.qint16, tf.quint16, tf.qint32`.

	/**
		Quantize the 'input' tensor of type float to 'output' tensor of type 'T'.
		
		[min_range, max_range] are scalar floats that specify the range for
		the 'input' data. The 'mode' attribute controls exactly which calculations are
		used to convert the float values to their quantized equivalents.
		
		In 'MIN_COMBINED' mode, each value of the tensor will undergo the following:
		
		```
		out[i] = (in[i] - min_range) * range(T) / (max_range - min_range)
		if T == qint8, out[i] -= (range(T) + 1) / 2.0
		```
		here `range(T) = numeric_limits<T>::max() - numeric_limits<T>::min()`
		
		*MIN_COMBINED Mode Example*
		
		Assume the input is type float and has a possible range of [0.0, 6.0] and the
		output type is quint8 ([0, 255]). The min_range and max_range values should be
		specified as 0.0 and 6.0. Quantizing from float to quint8 will multiply each
		value of the input by 255/6 and cast to quint8.
		
		If the output type was qint8 ([-128, 127]), the operation will additionally
		subtract each value by 128 prior to casting, so that the range of values aligns
		with the range of qint8.
		
		If the mode is 'MIN_FIRST', then this approach is used:
		
		```
		number_of_steps = 1 << (# of bits in T)
		range_adjust = number_of_steps / (number_of_steps - 1)
		range = (range_max - range_min) * range_adjust
		range_scale = number_of_steps / range
		quantized = round(input * range_scale) - round(range_min * range_scale) +
		  numeric_limits<T>::min()
		quantized = max(quantized, numeric_limits<T>::min())
		quantized = min(quantized, numeric_limits<T>::max())
		```
		
		The biggest difference between this and MIN_COMBINED is that the minimum range
		is rounded first, before it's subtracted from the rounded value. With
		MIN_COMBINED, a small bias is introduced where repeated iterations of quantizing
		and dequantizing will introduce a larger and larger error.
		
		One thing to watch out for is that the operator may choose to adjust the
		requested minimum and maximum values slightly during the quantization process,
		so you should always use the output ports as the range for further calculations.
		For example, if the requested minimum and maximum values are close to equal,
		they will be separated by a small epsilon value to prevent ill-formed quantized
		buffers from being created. Otherwise, you can end up with buffers where all the
		quantized values map to the same float value, which causes problems for
		operations that have to perform further calculations on them.
